              Greetings, traveler! I am <span className="text-treasure font-bold">Harsh Bharat Dave</span>, 
              a Level 23 UI/UX Designer who has mastered the ancient arts of combining imagination, 
              storytelling, and usability.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-foreground/90">
              My quest began in the mystical lands of design, where I learned to forge pixel-perfect 
              interfaces and craft experiences that guide users through their own adventures. Armed with 
              the powers of Figma, Framer, and the React spell book, I create portals (apps) that are 
              both beautiful and functional.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground/90">
              Whether it's designing the next legendary interface or coding magical prototypes, I approach 
              every challenge with creativity and determination. My journey as an Product Designer & Developer is just 
              beginning, but the path ahead is filled with exciting quests.
            </p>
