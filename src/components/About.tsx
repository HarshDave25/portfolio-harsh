              <span className="text-treasure font-bold">
                Harsh Bharat Dave
              </span>
              , a Level 23 UI/UX Designer who has mastered the ancient arts of
              combining imagination, storytelling, and usability.
            </p>

            <p>
              My quest began in the mystical lands of design, where I learned to
              forge pixel-perfect interfaces and craft experiences that guide
              users through their own adventures. Armed with the powers of
              <span className="text-treasure"> Figma</span>,{" "}
              <span className="text-treasure">Framer</span>, and the{" "}
              <span className="text-treasure">React spell book</span>, I create
              portals (apps) that are both beautiful and functional.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether it‚Äôs designing the next legendary interface or coding
              magical prototypes, I approach every challenge with creativity and
              determination. My journey as a Product Designer & Developer is
              just beginning, but the path ahead is filled with exciting quests.
            </p>
